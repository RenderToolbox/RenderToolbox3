classdef RtbBatchRenderStrategy < handle
    %% Abstract interface for how to do batch rendering.
    % We have at least two ways to do things with RenderToolbox3: the
    % original, deprecated way with Collada scenes and text mappings files,
    % and the new way with Assimp and JSON mappings files.  We
    % think the new way is better.  But we still want to be able to do
    % things the old way, at least for the foreseeable future.
    %
    % So we define this idea of a batch render "strategy".  It's an outline
    % of what we need to get done when batch rendering.  We reimplement the
    % batch rendering functions to follow this abstract outline.  Then we
    % will implement two or more concrete strategies: one for the old
    % Collada way of doing things, and one for the new Assimp and JSON.
    %
    % All of this deals with the basic scene representation (ie Collada
    % file vs Mexximp struct).  When it comes to the renderer, we delegate
    % to an RtbConverter and an RtbRenderer. The converter knows how to
    % convert the basic scene representation to a renderer-native format.
    % The renderer doesn't care about the basic scene representation, and
    % only deals with the renderer-native format.
