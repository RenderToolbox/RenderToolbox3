% Check the winding order of vertices in 3D space.
%   @param vertices m x 3 matrix of XYZ triples
%
% @details
% Returns true if the given @a vertices are wound in clockwise order.  For
% porposes of this function, "clockwise" is defined arbitrarily and it's
% only meaningful to compare sets of @a vertices for @em differences in
% winding order.
%
% @details
% @a vertices should contain at least 3 XYZ triples.  Only the first 3 will
% be checked for winding order.  Subtracts the first vertex from each of
% the next two vertices, and takes the cross product of the differences.
% If the product has a non-negative z-component, @a vertices are
% "clockwise".  Otherwise they're "counter-clockwise".
%
% @details
% Returns true if @a vertices are wound in clockwise order.

% @details
% Usage:
%   isClockwise = IsVerticesClockwise(vertices)
