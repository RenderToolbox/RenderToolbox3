function fileInfo = rtbResolveFilePath(fileName, rootFolder)
%% Resolve a path to the given file.
%
% fileInfo = rtbResolveFilePath(fileName, rootFolder)
%
% Searches for the given fileName, which might be a plain file name, or
% a relative or absolute path to a file.  First searches within the given
% rootFolder and its subfolders for a file that matches fileName.  If no
% match is found within rootFolder, searches for a matching file on the
% Matlab path.
%
% Returns a struct of info about the given fileName, with the following
% fields:
%   - verbatimName - fileName exactly as given
%   - rootFolder - rootFolder exactly as given
%   - isRootFolderMatch - true only if fileName was found within rootFolder
%   - resolvedPath - unambiguous path to the given fileName
%   - absolutePath - full absolute path to the given fileName, if found
%
% resolvedPath will be an unambiguous path to the first file that
% matches fileName.   If the match was found within rootFolder,
% resolvedPath is the relative path to the matched file, starting from
% rootFolder.  If the match was found on the Matlab path, but not in
% rootFolder, resolvedPath is the full absolute path to the matched
% file.  If no match was found, resolvedPath is the empty string ''.
%
% In all cases isRootFolderMatch indicates whether or not a match was
% found within rootFolder.  When isRootFolderMatch is true, resolvedPath
% should be treated as a relative path.
