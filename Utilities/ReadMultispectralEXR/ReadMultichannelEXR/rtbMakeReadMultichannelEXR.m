function rtbMakeReadMultichannelEXR()
%% Compile and test the MakeReadMultichannelEXR Mex-function.
%
% rtbMakeReadMultichannelEXR() Compiles the ReadMultichannelEXR() mex
% function from source.  Assumes that the OpenEXR libraries have been
% installed on the system at user/, user/local/, or opt/local/.  If the
% libraries are installed somewhere else on your system, you should copy
% this file and edit the  INC and LINC variables to contain the correct
% include and library paths  for your OpenEXR installation.
%
% Attempts to read a sample OpenEXR image and plot channel data in a new
% figure, to verify that the funciton compiled successfully.
%
% On Ubuntu, you may wish to run the following command to get the
% dependencies you need:
%   sudo apt-get install openexr libopenexr-dev libilmbase-dev zlib1g-dev
%
% On OS X, you can probably find a similar command with Homebrew.
